This node is deprecated.
A more capable node along the same lines is planned, at which point this one will disappear.

This node implements nested first-order allpass filters.

In order to specify how this nesting works, one must call the various control functions.
This node's operation is somewhat analogous to old-style OpenGL programming: there is an implicit context that is manipulated via calling functions, as opposed to a set of properties to be set.

Filters may be appended in series.
At any time, however, it is possible to append a nested allpass filter.
When a nested allpass filter is appended, any new filters are appended to the end of the nested allpass's delay line; call the function Lav_nestedAllpassNodeEndNesting to end nesting and return to the previous level.
Multiple levels of nesting are supported.

In order to read this node's output, be sure to call Lav_nestedAllpassNetworkNodeAppendReader; any audio that heads through this special no-op filter will be read and placed in this node's output buffers.

In order to finalize the construction of a network, call Lav_nestedAllpassNetworkNodeCompile.
This function takes all previously issued commands, wraps them up, and uses them to replace the current network.
After a call to this function, all subsequent commands are building a new network whose changes will not  be heard until this function is called.

The default configuration of this node is silence.  To return to this configuration at any time, call Lav_nestedAllpassNetworkNodeCompile without issuing any commands first.

Note that this node is extremely slow as compared to other Libaudioverse nodes.
The primary use of this node is for experimentation purposes and the development of faster Libaudioverse nodes."""
