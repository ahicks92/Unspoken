They remain here for now for compatibility with other components of my stack.

Remix a buffer.  These can be used without initialization.
- The standard channel counts 1, 2, 6 (5.1) and 8 (7.1) are mixed between each other appropriately.
- Otherwise, if input is mono and output is not mono, the input is copied to all channels.
- Otherwise, we keep min(inputChannels, outputChannels) channels of audio data, and fill any remaining output channels with zero.

These functions come in two variants.
- The uninterleaved version expects audio data as contiguous frames.
- The interleaved version expects audio data as an array of buffers.

In-place usage is not safe.

zeroFirst is intended for applications that need to accumulate data; if true (the default) buffers are zeroed before use.
