Welcome to the documentation for the Libaudioverse Python bindings.
Libaudioverse is a multi-language library for audio synthesis along the lines of WebAudio, aimed primarily at games.
Among it's many features, it includes a fully functioning 3D simulation, environmental reverb, and a large number of components for instrument and sound synthesis.

As Libaudioverse is language-agnostic, this page provides only a Python API reference.
You can find examples `at the official GitHub repository <http://github.com/camlorn/libaudioverse>`_.
There are also a number of conceptual overviews `in the language-agnostic manual <http://camlorn.github.io/libaudioverse/docs/libaudioverse_manual.html>`_.
Since Python is the closest language to pseudocode, the language-agnostic manual primarily uses it for examples.
