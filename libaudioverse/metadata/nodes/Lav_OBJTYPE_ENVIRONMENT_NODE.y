properties:
  Lav_3D_POSITION:
    name: position
    type: float3
    default: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    doc_description: |
      The position of the listener, in world coordinates.
  Lav_3D_ORIENTATION:
    name: orientation
    type: float6
    default: [0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
    doc_description: |
      The orientation of the listener.
      The first three elements are a vector representing the direction in which the listener is looking
      and the second 3 a vector representing the direction in which a rod pointing out of the top of the listener's head would be pointing
      
      This property packs these vectors because they must never be modified separately.
      Additionally, they should both be unit vectors and must also be orthoganal.
      
      the default situates the listener such that positive x is right, positive y is up, and positive z is behind the listener.
      The setting (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1) will situate the listener such that
      positive x is right and positive y is forward.
      For those not familiar with trigonometry and who wish to consider positive x east and positivve y north, the following formula
      will turn the listener to face a scertain direction specified in radians clockwise of north:
      (sin(theta), cos(theta), 0, 0, 0, 1).
      As usual, note that radians=degrees*PI/180.
  Lav_ENVIRONMENT_DISTANCE_MODEL:
    name: distance_model
    default: Lav_DISTANCE_MODEL_LINEAR
    type: int
    value_enum: Lav_DISTANCE_MODELS
    doc_description: |
      The distance model for any source configured to delegate to the environment.
      Sources are configured to delegate to the environment by default.
      
      Distance models control how quickly sources get quieter as they move away from the listener.
      
      Note that it is possible to set this property to {{"Lav_DISTANCE_MODEL_DELEGATE"|codelit}}.
      Due to internal limitations, this does not generate an error.
      Instead, this case is equivalent to a linear distance model.
      Do not rely on this behavior.  The internal ilimitations preventing this will be lifted in future.
  Lav_ENVIRONMENT_DEFAULT_MAX_DISTANCE:
    name: default_max_distance
    range: [0.0, INFINITY]
    type: float
    default: 50.0
    doc_description: |
      The default max distance for new sources.
      The max distance of a source is the maximum distance at which that source will be audible.
  Lav_ENVIRONMENT_DEFAULT_SIZE:
    name: default_size
    type: float
    range: [0.0, INFINITY]
    default: 0.0
    doc_description: |
      The default size for new sources.
      Sources aare approximated as spheres, with 0 being the special case of a point source.
      Size is used to determine the listener's distance from a source.
  Lav_ENVIRONMENT_PANNING_STRATEGY:
    name: panning_strategy
    type: int
    default: Lav_PANNING_STRATEGY_STEREO
    value_enum: Lav_PANNING_STRATEGIES
    doc_description: |
      The panning strategy for any source configured to delegate to the environment.
      All new sources delegate to the environment by default.
      
      Note that it is possible to set this property to the delgate panning strategy.
      Due to internal limitations, this case does not error but is instead equivalent to using stereo panning.
      These limitations will be lifted in future; do not rely on this behavior.
  Lav_ENVIRONMENT_OUTPUT_CHANNELS:
    name: output_channels
    type: int
    range: [0, 8]
    default: 2
    doc_description: |
      Environments are not smart enough to determine the number of channels their output needs to have.
      If you are using something greater than stereo, i.e. 5.1, you need to change this property.
      The specific issue solved by this property is the case in which one source is set to something different than all others,
      or where the app changes the panning strategies of sources after creation.
      
      Values besides 2, 4, 6, or 8 do not usually have much meaning.
  Lav_ENVIRONMENT_DEFAULT_REVERB_DISTANCE:
    name: default_reverb_distance
    type: float
    range: [0.0, INFINITY]
    default: 30.0
    doc_description: |
      The default distance at which a source will be heard only in the reverb.
      
      See documentation on the {{"Lav_OBJTYPE_SOURCE_NODE"|node}} node.
extra_functions:
  Lav_environmentNodePlayAsync:
    doc_description: |
      Play a buffer, using the specified position and the currently set defaults on the world for distance model and panning strategy.
      This is the same as creating a buffer and a source, but Libaudioverse retains control of these objects.
      When the buffer finishes playing, the source is automatically disposed of.
    params:
      bufferHandle: The buffer to play.
      x: The x-component of the  position.
      y: The y-component of the position.
      z: The z-component of the position.
      isDry: If true, we avoid sending to the effect sends configured as defaults.
  Lav_environmentNodeAddEffectSend:
    doc_description: |
      Add an effect send.
      
      Effect sends are aggregates of all sources configured to make use of them.
      This function's return value is the index of the newly created effecct send.
      
      The world gains an additional output for every added effect send.
      This output aggregates all audio of sources configured to send to it, including the panning effects on those sources.
      The returned index is the number of the newly created output.
      
      Two special cases are worth noting.
      
      First, a mono effect send includes all sources with only attenuation applied.
      
      Second, if the effect send has 4 channels, it may be configured to be a reverb effect send with the {{"isReverb"|param}} parameter.
      Reverb effect sends are treated differently in terms of attenuation:
      as sources move away from the listener, their dry path becomes less but the audio sent to the reverb effect send becomes greater.
      
      No effect send can include occlusion effects.
    params:
      channels: The number of channels the effect send is to have. Must be 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
      isReverb: nonzero if this is a reverb effect send.
      connectByDefault: If nonzero, all existing and newly created sources will send to this effect send unless disabled.
inputs: null
outputs:
  - [dynamic, "Depends on the output_channels property.", "The output of the 3D environment."]
doc_name: environment
doc_description: |
  This is the entry point to the 3D simulation capabilities.
  Environment nodes hold the information needed to pan sources, as well as acting as an aggregate output for all sources that use this environment.
  
  
  Note that the various properties for default values do not affect already created sources.
  It is best to configure these first.
  Any functionality to change a property on all sources needs to be implemented by the app, and is not offered by Libaudioverse.
