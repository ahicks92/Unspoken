functions:
  Lav_initialize:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      This function initializes Libaudioverse.
      You must call it before calling any other functions.
  Lav_shutdown:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Shuts down Libaudioverse.
      You must call this function at the end of your application.
      Failure to do so may cause crashes as Libaudioverse may attempt to make use of resources you passed it as your app shuts down,
      for example callbacks.
      
      Once this function has been called, all pointers and handles from Libaudioverse are invalid.
      Continuing to make use of any resource Libaudioverse has given you after this point will cause crashing.
  Lav_isInitialized:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Indicates whether Libaudioverse is initialized.
  Lav_errorGetMessage:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Get the message corresponding to the last error that happened on this thread.
      The returned pionter is valid until another error occurs.
      The main purpose of this function is debugging and bindings.
  Lav_errorGetFile:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Get the Libaudioverse cpp file where the most recent error on this thread occured.
      The pointer returned is valid until another error occurs on this thread.
      This function is mainly for debugging and bindings.
  Lav_errorGetLine:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Return the source line for the last error that occured on this thread.
      This function is mainly for debugging and bindings.
  Lav_free:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Frees pointers that Libaudioverse gives  you.
      There are a limited number of cases wherein Libaudioverse will return a newly allocated pointer.
      Such cases should be clearly documented in this manual.
      In order to free such memory, be sure to use this function rather than the normal system free:
      on some platforms, the Libaudioverse DLL may not be using the same C runtime,
      and the memory passed to you may be allocated from internal caches.
      
      This function is no-op after shutdown, but should not be used before initialization.
      This behavior simplifies writing garbage-collected bindings to Libaudioverse, and should not be relied on directly.
    params:
      ptr: The pointer to free.
  Lav_handleIncRef:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Newly allocated Libaudioverse handles have a reference count of 1.
      This function allows incrementing this reference count.
      If you are working in C, this function is not very helpful.
      It is used primarily by the various programming language bindings
      in order to make the garbage collector play nice.
    params:
      handle: The handle whose reference count is to be incremented.
  Lav_handleDecRef:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Decrement the reference count of a Libaudioverse handle.
      This function is the equivalent to Lav_free for objects.
      Note that this is only a decrement.
      if you call it in the middle of a block or in a variety of other situations, you may see the same handle again via a callback.
      
      It is not possible for Libaudioverse to provide a guaranteed freeing function.
      Such a function would have to block, making it unusable in garbage collected languages.
      Furthermore, in the case of objects like buffers, various internal Libaudioverse properties could conceivably need to hold onto the object.
      Internally, Libaudioverse uses shared pointers to make sure this cannot happen,
      but at the cost of not being able to guarantee instant resource freeing.
      
      This function is no-op after shutdown, but should not be used before initialization.
      This behavior simplifies writing garbage-collected bindings to Libaudioverse, and should not be relied on directly.
    params:
      handle: The handle whose reference count we are decrementing.
  Lav_handleGetAndClearFirstAccess:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Checks the handle's first access flag and clears it.
      This is an atomic operation, used by bindings to automatically increment and decrement handle reference counts appropriately.
      Namely, in the case of this function indicating that the first access flag is set, we avoid incrementing the reference count as it is 1 but we have no other external copies of the handle which will be decremented.
    params:
      handle: The handle to check.
      destination: 1 if the first access flag is set, otherwise 0.
  Lav_handleGetRefCount:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      For debugging.  Allows obtaining the current reference count of the handle.
    params:
      handle: The handle to obtain the reference count of
      destination: After a call to this function, contains the reference count of the handle.
  Lav_handleGetType:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Returns the type of the handle.
    params:
      handle: The handle to obtain the type of.
      destination: A {{"Lav_OBJTYPES"|enum}} constant corresponding to the handle's type.
  Lav_setLoggingCallback:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Configure a callback to receive logging messages.
      Note that this function can be called before Libaudioverse initialization.
      
      The callback will receive 3 parameters: level, message, and is_final.
      Level is the logging level.
      Message is the message to log.
      is_final is always 0, save when the message is the last message the logging callback will receive, ever.
      Use is_final to determine when to deinitialize your Libaudioverse logging.
    params:
      cb: The callback to use for logging.
  Lav_getLoggingCallback:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Get the logging callback.
    params:
      destination: The pointer to the logging callback if set, otherwise NULL.
  Lav_setLoggingLevel:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Set the logging level.
      You will receive messages via the logging callback for all levels  greater than the logging level.
    params:
      level: The new logging level.
  Lav_getLoggingLevel:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Get the current logging level
  Lav_setHandleDestroyedCallback:
    category: core
    doc_description: |
      Set the callback to be called when a Libaudioverse handle is permanently destroyed.
      Libaudioverse handles cannot be reused.
      When this callback is called, it is the last time your program can see the specific handle in question,
      and further use of that handle will cause crashes.
      
      This exists primarily for language bindings.
      If there is a case in which your C app must know if a handle is still valid, you may have design issues.
    params:
      cb: The callback to be called when handles are destroyed.
  Lav_deviceGetCount:
    category: devices
    doc_description: |
      Get the number of audio devices on the system.
  Lav_deviceGetName:
    category: devices
    doc_description: |
      Returns a human-readable name for the specified audio device.
      
      The string that this function outputs is encoded in UTF8.
    params:
      index: The index of the audio device.
      destination: Contains a pointer to  a string allocated by Libaudioverse containing the name. Use {{"Lav_free"|function}} on this string when done with it.
  Lav_deviceGetChannels:
    category: devices
    doc_description: |
      Query the maximum number of channels for this device before downmixing occurs.
      You should query the user as to the type of audio they want rather than relying on this function.
      Some operating systems and backends will perform their own downmixing and happily claim 8-channel audio on stereo headphones.
      Furthermore, some hardware and device drivers will do the same.
      It is not possible for Libaudioverse to detect this case.
    params:
      index: The index of the audio device.
  Lav_createSimulation:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      Creates a  simulation.
      The new simulation has no associated audio device.
      To make it output, use `Lav_simulationSetOutputDevice`.
    params:
      sr: The sampling rate of the new simulation.
      blockSize: The block size of the new simulation.
  Lav_simulationGetBlockSize:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      Query the block size of the specified simulation.
  Lav_simulationGetBlock:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      Gets a block of audio from the simulation and advances its time.
      using this with a simulation that is outputting audio to an audio device will not work well.
      
      You must allocate enough space to hold exactly one block of audio: the simulation's block size times the number of channels requested floating point values.
    params:
      simulationHandle: The handle of the simulation to read a block from.
      channels: The number of channels we want. The simulations' output will be upmixed or downmixed as appropriate.
      mayApplyMixingMatrix: If 0, drop any additional channels in the simulation's output and set any  missing channels in the simulation's output to 0. Otherwise, if we can, apply a mixing matrix.
      buffer: The memory to which to write the result.
  Lav_simulationGetSr:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      Query the simulation's sampling rate.
  Lav_simulationSetOutputDevice:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      Set the output device of the simulation.
      -1 is the system default.  0 and above are specific audio devices, matching the indices returned by the enumeration functions.
      
      Note that it is possible to change the output device of a simulation even after it has been set.
      
      After the output device has been set, calls to `Lav_simulationGetBlock` will error.
      
      The parameters {{"minLatency"|param}}, {{"startLatency"|param}}, and {{"maxLatency"|param}} are hints as to the latency you wish to have.
      The audio backends attempt to optimize themselves according to the CPU load of your application and other factors.
      These parameters control this optimization.
      If your application can suddenly and frequently cause CPU usage to spike, set {{"minLatency"|param}} to something greater than 0.
      The {{"startLatency"|param}} parameter is the latency at which the audio backend will start audio.
      This should usually be somewhat high, as applications often begin by creating a large number of objects.
      The audio backends will reduce latency as rapidly as is safe.
    params:
      index: The output device  the simulation is to play on.
      channels: The number of channels we wish to output.
      minLatency: The minimum latency your application can tolerate. 0.0 is a good value in most cases.
      startLatency: A hint as to the latency the audio backend should start with.
      maxLatency: The maximum latency your application can tolerate.
  Lav_simulationClearOutputDevice:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      Clear a simulation's output device.
      
      This is no-op if no output device has been set.
      If it has, this function will block until queued audio finishes.
      
      After a call to this function, it is again safe to use `Lav_simulationGetBlock`.
  Lav_simulationLock:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      All operations between a call to this function and a call to `Lav_simulationUnlock` will happen together, with no blocks mixed between them.
      This is equivalent to assuming that the simulation is a lock, with  all of the required caution that implies.
      If you do not call {{"Lav_simulationUnlock"|function}} in a timely manner, then audio will stop until you do.
      accessing another simulation for which your app uses {{"Lav_simulationLock"|function}} or
      locking or unlocking another lock are both  dangerous operations.
      Blocking will cause glitches in audio, but is otherwise safe.
  Lav_simulationUnlock:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      Release the internal lock of a simulation, allowing normal operation to resume.
      This is to be used after a call to {{"Lav_simulationLock"|function}} and on the same thread as that call; calling it in any other circumstance or on any other thread invokes undefined behavior.
  Lav_simulationSetBlockCallback:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      Set a callback to be called just before every block and in the audio thread.
      This callback can and should access the Libaudioverse API:
      the point of it is that you can use it to perform tasks where missing even one block would be problematic, i.e. very precise scheduling of events.
      
      This  callback can even block, though this will slow down audio mixing and may cause glitchy audio.
      The one thing you should never do in this callback is access anything belonging to another simulation, as this can cause deadlock.
      
      The callback receives two parameters: the simulation to which it is associated and the time in simulation time that corresponds to the beginning of the block about to be mixed.
    params:
      callback: The callback to use.
      userdata: An extra parameter that will be passed to the callback.
  Lav_simulationWriteFile:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      Write the simulation's output to the specified file.
      
      This function advances the simulation as though {{"Lav_simulationGetBlock"|function}} were called multiple times, the number of times determined by {{"duration"|param}}.
      As a consequence, it is not possible to use this function while the simulation is outputting.
      
      The file format is determined from the path.
      Recognized extensions include ".wav" and ".ogg", which are guaranteed to work on all systems.
      In all cases, reasonable defaults are used for those settings which are specific to the encoder.
    params:
      path: The path to the audio file to be written.
      channels: The number of channels in the resulting file.
      duration: Duration of the resulting file, in seconds.
      mayApplyMixingMatrix: 1 if applying a mixing matrix should be attempted, 0 if extra channels should be treated as 0 or dropped.  This is the same behavior as with {{"Lav_simulationGetBlock"|function}}.
  Lav_simulationSetThreads:
    category: simulations
    doc_description: |
      Set the number of threads that the simulation is allowed to use.
      
      The value of the threads parameter may be from 1 to infinity.
      When set to 1, processing happens in the thread who calls {{"Lav_simulationGetBlock"|function}}.
      All other values sleep the thread calling {{"Lav_simulationGetBlock"|function}} and perform processing in background threads.
    params:
      threads: The number of threads to use for processing.  Must be at least 1.  Typical values include 1 and 1 less than the available cores.
  Lav_simulationGetThreads:

      channels: The number of audio channels in the data; frames*channels is the total length of the array in samples.
      frames: The number of frames of audio data; frames*channels is the length of the array in samples.
      data: A pointer to the beginning of the array to load from.
  Lav_bufferNormalize:
    category: buffers
    dosc_descriptionL: |
      Normalize the buffer.
      This function divides by the sample whose value is furthest from zero.
      The effect is to make sounds as loud as possible without clipping or otherwise distorting the sound.
    params:
      bufferHandle: The buffer to normalize.
  Lav_bufferGetDuration:
    category: buffers
    doc_description: |
      Get the duration of the buffer in seconds.
    params:
