/**The automators.

The name for this component is borrowed from Webaudio.  This file only contains the abstract definition.

Adding new automators is similar to nodes: create a file, define the class, create a creation function.

An automator itself must be equivalent a pure function with some parameters. bound.
Put another way, multiple calls to start *must* be supported.
Furthermore, all automators must have a well-defined final value.

Subclasses should set duration in their constructors, should they need to continue past their scheduled time.*/
